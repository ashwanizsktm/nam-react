what is config driven UI:-
Answer:-  when the UI is driven by configs it known as config driven ui what does it mean is if I open
    swiggy.com all the availavle resturant card data will be different for Banglore, Chennai, Mumbai and many 
    more so for all the cities the data is getting drirven by the configs & all these configs are handled by
    backend. we won't make different website for different cities right, so we need something as config driven UI.


Ques:- why we need the keys in the components?
Answer: - let's say we have a parent component and it has many child compoents, while rendering in the dom 
  these child component needs to have unique id for each. they should be uniquely represented because let's say if 
  other resturant card is getting added on the page if this resturant card is having an unique id then it' will just render 
  only those which are added, it'll not rerender the page to put those new added cards. it helps in improving the performance
  of the app. incase we are not adding key it'll rerender the page once again to load all the resturant card it's a huge perfornce hit.

 logically we can use index as key but React itself says that don't use index as a key. it may change the order of the resturant card
