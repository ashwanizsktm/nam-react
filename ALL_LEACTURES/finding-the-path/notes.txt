There are 2 types of routing
1. Client side routing:- In this routing process all the pages/components bundled together so whenever we navigate to 
other page then browser doesn't refresh it just get changed  to the other component with the help of routing mechanism(provided by react router dom).

2. Server side routing : - initially we had about, contact, & products etc in the header & when we clicked then network call
  happens & it send the request to server & we used to fetch these pages, this process is called server side routing also it
  is called as multi page application.
