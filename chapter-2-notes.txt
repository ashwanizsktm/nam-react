1. ^ the caret inside the package.josn update any packages to the minor version
  EX:- "^2.7.4" will automatically updated to "^2.8.4" to "^2.9.4"

2. ~ the tilde inside the package.josn update any packages to the major version

   1. package-lock.json is an important file which keeps all track of package.josn packages version.
      many a time code works in development but doesn't work in production so, in these case it

    2.  it uses the exact version of any dependency specified in package.json.


4. we use react and react-dom packages instead of cdn bcz first it'll make a n/w call & we have 
   no idea whether the server is down or it has got everything which we need & most importantly
   when we are using npm it's easier to control all our dependency with the control in hour hand.
