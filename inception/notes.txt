# React concepts
1. what is cdn why we use it instead of npm intallation?
A CDN allows for the quick transfer of assets needed for loading Internet content, including HTML pages, JavaScript files, stylesheets, images, and videos. 
A CDN hosts code on a third party server network that your front end code accesses when the page loads. You donâ€™t need to worry about hosting the code with your web site.
NPM is intended for use in a development environment that combines the whole NPM sourced code base on your dev or production web site.

2. crossorigin
The crossorigin attribute sets the mode of the request to an HTTP CORS Request.
Web pages often make requests to load resources on other servers. Here is where CORS comes in.
A cross-origin request is a request for a resource (e.g. style sheets, iframes, images, fonts, or scripts) from another domain.
